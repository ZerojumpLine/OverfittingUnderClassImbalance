Modifications:

The version provided here is a modified version by Konstantinos Kamnitsas in order to allow running the examples of the DeepMedic software.

The Flair_subtrMeanDivStd.nii.gz and T1c_subtrMeanDivStd.nii.gz were intensity normalised to a zero-mean, unary-variance within the brain area.
The brain mask was generated by thresholding the air.
